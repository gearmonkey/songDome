"Two songs enter, one song plays!"

When it works, you should be able to call:

http:/someDomain/songDome/artistA/artistB/select_track_by/

[select_track_by is optional]

which will give the following JSON on success (blocking till audio is available, cause I'm lazy):
{
return_code:'ok',
available_as: 'http://url.to.the/battle.mp3'
}
